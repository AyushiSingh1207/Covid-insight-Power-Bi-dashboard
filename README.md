## Overview
The **COVID-19 Analysis Dashboard** provides a visual representation of COVID-19 data, offering insights into confirmed cases, cured cases, and deaths across different states and union territories in India. This dashboard helps in understanding the impact of the pandemic through key performance indicators (KPIs) and visual analytics.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
1. **Total Confirmed Cases** – Displays the overall number of COVID-19 confirmed cases across India.
2. **Total Cured Cases** – Indicates the total number of people who have recovered from COVID-19.
3. **Total Deaths** – Represents the total number of COVID-19-related fatalities.
4. **Confirmed Cases by State/Union Territory** – A bar chart highlighting the distribution of confirmed cases across different states.
5. **Deaths by State/Union Territory** – A pie chart illustrating the proportion of total deaths in each state.
6. **Cured Cases by State/Union Territory** – A pie chart showing the recovery distribution among states.
7. **Geographical Spread of Cases** – A map visualization displaying the concentration of cases across different locations in India.

## Features
- **Interactive Visuals** – The dashboard contains bar charts, pie charts, and a geographical map for better data interpretation.
- **Data Segmentation** – The information is categorized by states and union territories for focused analysis.
- **Real-time Insights** – Key statistics on confirmed cases, cured cases, and deaths provide a quick snapshot of the situation.

## Data Cleaning Process
To ensure accurate and meaningful insights, the dataset underwent the following cleaning steps:
1. **Handling Missing Values** – Null or missing values in case counts were replaced with zero or interpolated based on trends.
2. **Removing Duplicates** – Duplicate entries were identified and removed to prevent data inflation.
3. **Standardizing Formats** – Dates, state names, and numeric values were standardized for consistency.
4. **Filtering Outliers** – Extreme values that were inconsistent with trends were analyzed and corrected.
5. **Data Type Conversion** – Converted categorical and numerical data to appropriate formats for better processing.

## Technologies Used
- **Power BI** – Used for creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.
- **Data Sources** – COVID-19 dataset including state-wise data on confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths.
- **Microsoft Bing Maps** – Integrated for geographical visualization of case distribution.
- **Python & Pandas** – Used for data cleaning and preprocessing.

## Usage Instructions
1. Open the **COVID-19 Analysis Dashboard** in Power BI.
2. Navigate through different visualizations to analyze COVID-19 trends.
3. Use interactive filters (if available) to explore data for specific states or timeframes.
4. Interpret the charts and insights to understand the pandemic's impact on different regions.

## Interpretation Guidelines
- **High confirmed cases in a state** indicate a larger spread of the virus.
- **Recovery rate trends** can help assess the healthcare system's effectiveness.
- **Death rate analysis** can provide insights into the severity of cases in different regions.

## Conclusion
This dashboard serves as a comprehensive analytical tool for tracking COVID-19 trends in India. By leveraging data visualizations, users can gain insights into the spread, recovery, and fatality rates, assisting policymakers, researchers, and healthcare professionals in decision-making.
